_**Beginners Guide**_

Welcome to the beginners guide <!-- hehe the game by Davey Wreden --> for setting up an instance of Cryb.
You can use the following guides on how to setup an instance of Cryb, even if you don't code yourself.

It should be pretty self explanatory, and we're working on creating guides for the platforms of your choice.

So, let's get started!
